subtitle: Bringing dataset visualization into the narrative

The following figures are all from datasets publicly available on the [Image Data Resource](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org). Rather than being screenshots they directly embed the full dataset using the HMS based Zarr viewer[^1] making them immediately accessible and explorable as part of the narrative.

This is made possible via a lightweight plugin to the publishing system that allows research communities to create, maintain and use their own visualizations that match their datasets and needs.

[^1]: The following examples use the [vizarr](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/vizarr) package from the Harvard Medical School.
